<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This package is for calculating dissolved gas concentrations in surfac water samples from reference air and water equilibrated gas samples.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## Usage
The functions in this package have the following purpose: (1) to format downloaded data, and (2) to calculate dissolved gas concentrations in surface water (mol L-1) from reference air and equilibrated air (ppmv) concentrations. See help files for individual functions for details. The general flow of using this package is:

1. download data from the NEON data portal, into location "myDataPath"
2. sdg_data <- def.format.sdg(dataDir = "myDataPath"), returns a data frame called sdg_data
3. sdg_calc <- def.calc.sdg(sdg_data), returns a data frame called sdg_calc with molar concentrations appended as columns
