<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This package is for calculating dissolved gas concentrations in surface water samples.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## Usage
The functions in this package have the following purpose: (1) to format downloaded data, (2) to calculate dissolved gas concentrations in surface water (mol L-1) from headspace source gas and equilibrated air (ppmv) concentrations, (3) to calculate 100% saturation dissolved gas concenrations (i.e. dissolved gas concentrations in equilibrium with atmosphere) from water temperature, barometric pressure, and atmospheric concentrations (ppmv). See help files for individual functions for details. The general flow of using this package is:

1. download data from the NEON data portal, into location "myDataPath"
2. sdg_data <- def.format.sdg(dataDir = "myDataPath"), returns a data frame called sdg_data
3. sdg_calc <- def.calc.sdg.conc(sdg_data), returns a data frame called sdg_calc with molar concentrations appended as columns
4. sdg_sat <- def.calc.sdg.sat(sdg_calc), returns a data frame called sdg_sat with gas 100% saturation concentrations and percent saturation in the water

## Calculation Summary
The concentration of gas<sub>i</sub> dissolved in the original water sample (mol L<sup>-1</sup>) is calculated from a mass balance of the measured headspace mixing ratio of gas<sub>i</sub> (ppmv), the calculated concentration in the equilibrated headspace water, and the volumes of the headspace water and headspace gas.  The calculations also require the pressure of the headspace equilibration (assumed to be equal to barometric pressure during sampling), the temperature of the headspace equilibration, the universal gas constant (R), and the Henry's Law Solubility Constant corrected to the temperature of the headspace equilibration system.

The 100% saturation concentration (i.e. dissolved gas concentrations in equilibrium with atmosphere) is calculated from the temperature of the water body, atmospheric pressure, and the concentration in the atmosphere (ppmv).

The following applies to gas<sub>i</sub>, where gas<sub>i</sub> is equal to CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, or CO<sub>2</sub>
     
1. The gas constant, R, equals 8.3144598 L kPa K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>
2. The dissolved gas concentration in the original water sample is calculated from a mass balance of the headspace equilibration system:<img src="eq_1.png" width="650px" />
    - _C<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>water_ is the concentration (mol L<sup>-1</sup>),of gas<sub>i</sub> dissolved in the original water sample.
    - _mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>wat_ is the total moles of gas<sub>i</sub> dissolved in the original water sample.
    - _mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>aireq_ is the total moles of gas<sub>i</sub> in the equilibrated headspace gas.
    - _mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>wateq_ is the total moles of gas<sub>i</sub> in the equilibrated water sample.
    - _mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>air_ is the total moles of gas<sub>i</sub> in the source gas used for the headspace equilibrium. If a pure gas, such as helium or nitrogen, is used as the headspace gas, then mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>air will likely be 0.  However, pure gases are often transported to the field in a gas bag and may be contaminted if the bag leaks or was not properly evacuated prior to filling.  In this case, a sample of the pure gas may be analyzed and the concentrations reporated here.  Another common approach is to use ambient air as the headspace source gas.  In this case, an air sample should be analyzed and reported here.  The term mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>air corrects the calculation for any amount of gas<sub>i</sub> contained in the headspace source gas.
    - _vol<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>_ is the volume of the original water sample.
3. mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>aireq is calculated from the Ideal Gas Law n = <sup>PV</sup>&frasl;<sub>RT</sub>. In this equation, P = partial pressure of gas<sub>i</sub> and T is the temperature of the headspace equilibration system.<img src="eq_2.png" width="450px" />
    - _ppmv<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>aireq_ is the measured mixing ratio of gas<sub>i</sub> in the equilibrated headspace gas.
    - _BP_ is the barometric pressure (kPa).
    - _vol<sub>air</sub>_ is the volume of source gas used in the headspace equilibrium (mL).
    - _T_ is the temperature of the headspace system (K).
    - _10<sup>-6</sup>_ is a constant used to convert the mixing ratio from micromol/mol (ppmv) to  mole/mole.
4. mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>air is calculated from the Ideal Gas Law, as above:<img src="eq_3.png" width="425px" />
    - _ppmv<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>air_ is the measured mixing ratio of gas<sub>i</sub> in the pure headspace source gas (i.e., before mixing with the water sample).
5. mol<sub>gas<sub>i</sub></sub>wateq is calculated from Henry's Law and the volume of water used in the headspace equilibration. Henry's Law states that the concentration of gas<sub>i</sub> dissolved in a water sample is equal to the product of the partial pressure of gas<sub>i</sub> in the overlying atmosphere (i.e., the headspace gas) and the Henry's Law Solubility Constant for gas<sub>i</sub> at the temperature of the water (H(T)).<img src="eq_4.png" width="550px" />
    - _10<sup>-6</sup>_ is a constant used to convert the mixing ratio from micromol/mol (ppmv) to  mole/mole.
    - _H(T)_ is obtained from the compilation of Sander (2015), see below.

6. Sander (2015) provides a compilation of Henry's Law Solubility Constants standardized to 298.15 K. This standardized Henry's Law Solubility Constant (H<sup>&Theta;</sup>) can be converted to the temperature of the headspace equilibration H(T) following:<img src="eq_5.png" width="300px" />
    - _T<sup>&Theta;</sup>_ is equal to 298.15 K.
    - <img src="eq_4_1.png" width="50px" /> is equal to the constant provided in column <img src="eq_4_2.png" width="50px" /> in Table 6 of Sander (2015).  This constant is equal to 2400 K, 1900 K, and 2700 K for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O, respectively.  It should be noted that Sander (2015) provides numerous estimates of H<sup>&Theta;</sup> and <img src="eq_4_2.png" width="50px" /> for each gas which introduces uncertainty into the dissolved gas concentration calculations.  The median values reported in Sander (2015) are used in this package.
