water (mL) [string]}

air (mL) [string]}

\item{baro}{Column name containing the data for barometric pressure at the time of 
equilibration (kPa) [string]}

\item{waterTemp}{Column name containing the data for temperature of the waterbody when 
sampled (celsius) [string]}

\item{headspaceTemp}{Column name containing the data for temperature of the water sample 
during the headspace equilibration (celsius) [string]}

equilibrated gas (ppmv) [string]}

\value{
This function returns dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations in surface water 
[M] based on headspace equilibration data. Function also returns dissolved 100% saturation 
concentrations  [M] of CO2, CH4, and N2O in surface waters. Outputs are appended as 
additional columns to the input data frame
}
\description{
This function calculates dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations from 
water samples based on inputs of equilibration conditions and reference and equilibrated 
air CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations. If samples were equilibrated with a pure gas that 
contains no CO2, CH4, or N2O, the concentrations for the reference air 
("concentrationCO2Air", "concentrationCH4Air", "concentrationN2OAir") for those gases 
should be set to 0.
