Description: Contains functions to format data and calculate dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O 
	concentrations in surface water from reference air and water equilibrated gas samples.
	The calculations require the volume of air and water that are equilibrated and the temperature
	and barometric pressure at the time of equilibration.
